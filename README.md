# Cloud Simulation Project
> The project is based on a 2017 Research Paper by Ahmad M. Manasrah and Hanan Ba Ali, titled "WorkFlow Scheduling Using Hybrid GA-PSO Algorithm".

We implemented the proposed algorithm in Java in Eclipse IDE using cloudsim framework to simulate Tasks as Cloudlets and Processors as Virtual Machines. Basic Outline of the main algorithm is as follows
