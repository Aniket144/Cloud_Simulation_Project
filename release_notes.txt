            Cloudsim Project to Release CloudSim Toolkit 3.0

The Cloudbus Project at The University of Melbourne, Australia  is proud to announce the
release of the new version of its Cloud simulation software, the CloudSim.

One year has passed since last version of CloudSim was released. Cloud computing now is
mainstream, and has been heavily adopted by different industries. It is also omnipresent in
conferences and journals from diverse fields such as high performance computing, grid computing,
distributed systems, operating systems, software engineering, databases and so on. CloudSim has
been present in publications in all the above fields.

To help in further developments in the field of Cloud computing regardless the main area of
application, new features and improvements were added to CloudSim 3.0. Having the project
hosted in Google code allowed us to have an enhanced feedback from users, via issue tracking
and group discussion. Based on this feedback, we could identify bugs, concepts that where being
misinterpreted by users and features of little significance and complexity. In response to this
feedback, we fixed all the identified bugs, clarified confusing aspects of the tool, and removed
features that were proven to be unpopular with users and just were making the APIs confusing.

This version of CloudSim brings enhanced modelling of power-aware and energy efficient Cloud
computing, and also a new package allowing modelling of internal data center topologies and
message-passing applications.

We encourage the community to keep collaborating with us by notifying us about any identified 
bugs, providing feedback on new features you would like to have in future versions of the toolkit, 
and also developing your own extension packages, which we will be happy to promote on the project's 
homepage. We will also be happy to list on our homepage scientific peer-reviewed papers, whose 
results were obtained with CloudSim. 

As in its previous version, all components developed as part of the CloudSim Toolkit are open
source released under the LGPL license to encourage innovation and pass full freedom to our users.

We would like to thanks all the support we have received from users all around the world. Your
contribution in finding and reporting bugs, proposing (and developing) new features, and even in
using CloudSim has been paramount in the success of the project.
